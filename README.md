8. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code.
     
  Install Required Extensions (if necessary):
Ensure you have any necessary language-specific or debugging extensions installed (e.g., for Python, C++, Node.js).
Open Your Project:
Open VS Code and navigate to File > Open Folder....
Select the folder containing your project files.

Create or Open the Program File:
Open the file containing the code you want to debug within VS Code.

Set Breakpoints:
Click in the gutter next to the line numbers in the code editor to set breakpoints. Breakpoints pause code execution at specific points for inspection.

Configure Launch Configuration:
Click on the Debugging icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use Ctrl+Shift+D).
Click on the gear icon (create a launch.json file) and select the environment or platform you are debugging for (e.g., Node.js, Python, C++).
VS Code will generate a launch.json file with default configurations. Customize these configurations as needed (e.g., specify the program to debug, command line arguments, environment variables).

Start Debugging:
Once your launch configuration is set up:
Click on the green play button (Start Debugging) in the Debug view, or press F5.
Alternatively, use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Debug: Start Debugging.
VS Code will start debugging your program and pause at the breakpoints you've set.

Debugging Controls:
Use the debugging controls in the top toolbar (e.g., continue, step over, step into, step out) to navigate through your code.
Use the Variables view to inspect the values of variables and expressions.

   -  What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
     Breakpoints:
Standard Breakpoints: Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line number. When the program execution reaches a breakpoint, it pauses, allowing you to inspect variables and the program's state.
Conditional Breakpoints: Specify conditions under which a breakpoint should be hit, enhancing control over when the debugger pauses.

Step-through Debugging:
Step Over: Execute the current line of code and move to the next line.
Step Into: Move into the function or method call at the current line.
Step Out: Execute the remaining lines of the current function and return to the caller.
Run to Cursor: Run the program until it reaches the line where the cursor is positioned.

Call Stack:
View the call stack to understand the hierarchy of function calls that led to the current point of execution. Navigate through the call stack to inspect variables and expressions at different levels.

9. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control?
installing Git and initializing a repository within VS Code.
Using the Source Control view to stage, commit, view changes, and manage branches.
Utilizing Git commands in the integrated terminal for advanced operations like branching, merging, pushing, and pulling.

    -  Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
To initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub:
Install Git, configure GitHub credentials, and create a repository on GitHub.
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
Make changes to your project, stage them for commit in VS Code, and commit locally.
Push the committed changes to GitHub using git push origin <branch-name>.
This process ensures that your project is version-controlled and synchronized between your local machine and GitHub, facilitating collaboration and backup of your codebase.
